[Question]: I would like to delete directories older than two days from /fullbackup/archive path. How do you do it using any scripting methods?

[Problem Statement]: I was tryng to find /path/ -type d -mtime +2 -print0 | xargs -r0 --. This command does not works as expected due to directory modified date for SAT, SUN and MON are Mondays date.
